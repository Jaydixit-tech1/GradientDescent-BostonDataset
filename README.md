📉 Gradient Descent From Scratch

Linear Regression Optimization using Python

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Gradient Descent from scratch to optimize a Linear Regression model.
The goal is to minimize prediction error by iteratively updating model parameters using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
